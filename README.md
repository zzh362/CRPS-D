## Dataset (CRPS-D)
We build a large-scale parking slot detection dataset (named CRPS-D), which includes various lighting distributions, diverse weather conditions, and challenging parking slot variants.

Now, the dataset can be downloaded in in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Lm7RdoMliTVDnYX9lnM_Z3qXytXDWbG).


# SS-PSD
